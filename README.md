# Awesome visualization research

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of data visualizations research papers, books, blog posts, and other readings. I aim to limit this to pieces that will be of interest to practitioners as well as academics. If you are looking for more practical tools and libraries see [awesome-dataviz](https://github.com/fasouto/awesome-dataviz). 

At present this list is very biased towards things I am reading for my personal research interests, but I'd gladly accept pull requests.

## Human Computer Interaction

- [The Effects of Interactive Latency on Exploratory Visual Analysis](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2014-Latency-InfoVis.pdf) - a look at how latency in a user interface can affect user behavior and impact what they learn about datasets
- [Past, Present and Future of User Interface Software Tools](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amulet/papers/futureofhci.pdf) - an overview of of successes and failures in user interface tools, ideas for thinking about them, and thoughts on the future

## Scientific Visualization

- [Principles of high-dimensional data visualization in astronomy](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/seamlessastronomy/files/heidelberg_ag.pdf) - this paper by Alyssa Goodman gives a good introduction to the concept of "linked views" (with the relevant history), and great more contemporary examples from domain sciences

- [How to make an engaging infographic]
(http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2016/12/30/bjsports-2016-097023)an interesting article about infographics in health promotion.

## Statistics and Uncertainty
